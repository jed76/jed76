## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a PhD on fungal community ecology at Aberystwyth University.
  - I am studying how fungal communities assemble as grasslands are restored from intensive agricultural management. I am looking at aboveground plant-pathogen networks with field identification and microscopy, and belowground fungal communities with eDNA metabarcoding.
  - At the same time I am studying the evolution of plant-pathogen networks from a theoretical perspective.
- ☘️ I also teach Irish Gaelic and am deeply interested in Gaelic historical linguistics.

## My languages

I mostly work in R but I also have a reasonable knowledge of scientific Python. I am currently attempting to learn Julia for ecological modelling. I also have a good knowledge of HTML and CSS which I write my websites in.

I speak English, Irish Gaelic, Spanish, and some Scottish Gaelic. I am learning Mandarin, Welsh, and Old Gaelic.
